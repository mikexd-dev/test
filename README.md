# Menyala NextJS Hackathon Starter

This Next.js Web3 Starter is a full stack starter repository designed for decentralized application (dApp) development during hackathons. It comes with TypeScript and is built to help you quickly get started with your Web3 project.

# Code Structure

Next13 introduce the concept of non-routes folder as defined by (), so any folder names such as (auth)
, (landing-unprotected) and (protected) do not affect the routes but act as the logical grouping of the pages and components.
so in the template example, we have the following routes:
- auth
- dashboard
- profile

Logical groupings that derived from the actual routes are (auth), (protected) and (unprotected)

UI Components generated from shadcn sdk are automatically parked in ```components/ui``` and are subjected to customisation. Custom UI components created should go directly under ```components``` folder. There can be subfolder like ```example1``` for logical grouping of components as well
